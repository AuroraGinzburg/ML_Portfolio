# Overview:

This is my  GitHub repo for machine learning projects. Check out the energy_usage folder for a fully developed project that goes from data scraping to deep neural network modeling.

The wind_turbines project is freelance work that I am doing for Decarbonfuse. That work is ongoing and the notebooks are very much a work in progress.

I have more projects in the works, I will upload those as they are nearing completion.
